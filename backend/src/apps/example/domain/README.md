# Domain

This is where the app flows, logic and data live.

This layer accepts protocol-agnostic payload, plain JavaScript object and returns one as well.

Technically it contains common code objects like services, dto/entities, and clients that call external services.

It also typically calls the data-access layer to retrieve or persist information

Here you should put features and flows.
Ex.:
- DTO
- Services
- Logic
